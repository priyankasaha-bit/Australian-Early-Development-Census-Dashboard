📖 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes data from the **Australian Early Development Census (AECD)** to understand the developmental progress of children across Australia.  

Using Tableau and Excel, the dashboard visualizes insights across **domains such as physical health, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication development**.  

The goal is to identify patterns of early childhood vulnerability, regional differences, and progress over time — empowering policymakers and educators to make informed, child-centered decisions.

---

🎯 **Key Objectives**
- Transform and structure raw AECD data for visual analytics in Tableau  
- Compare **developmental vulnerability** across domains, states, and demographic groups  
- Create an **interactive dashboard** with toggle options for viewing data as **absolute numbers or percentages**  
- Highlight areas requiring targeted intervention and monitor improvements over census cycles

📊 **Key Insights**
During my internship with Social Quest, I discovered that behind every data point lies a child’s story. Working with the 𝗔𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀 health dataset allowed me to uncover insights into the physical and emotional foundations shaping Australia’s future generations.

🟢 The proportion of children “on track” across all developmental domains has remained stable over the years, showing that despite rising participation numbers, children’s developmental outcomes have been resilient and consistent nationwide.
